#PYTHON-ASSIGNMENT-2
**TASK1**
There's no rocket science in these programs. 

In **Assignment 2 TASK1** to find whether a number is **even or odd**, all 
that had to be done was to use the input function to take the input at runtime and use modulus operator(%) on it with 2 as the divisor. If the remainder is 0, then the number is 'EVEN'(used 'if'), if there is some remainder, then 'ODD'(used 'elif'), and for any wrong inputs or miscellaneous cases, we have else.

**NOTE** While printing the entered number(integer) with something of another(string) commas and '+' could be used but 'f"{a} is an odd number"' prints the required output(spacing thing), so i used the better alternative.

**TASK2**
Here, in **Assignment 2 TASK2**
The program starts with the 'sum50' variable that adds and stores all the values of different iterations of the counter variable 'i' that is running a loop starting from 1 to 51(51 not included) using the code statement 'sum50=sum50+i' inside the loop. 
As mentioned before, all the numbers add up in the sum variable, which, after the loop ends, is printed in the required format.
