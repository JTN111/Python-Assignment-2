#PYTHON-ASSIGNMENT-2
**TASK1**
There's no rocket science in both the codes. 

In **Assignment 2 TASK1** to find whether a number is **even or odd**, all 
that had to be done was to use the input function to take the input on runtime and using modulus operator(%) on it with 2 as the divisor. If the remainder is 0 then the number is 'EVEN'(used 'if'), if there is some remainder than 'ODD'(used 'elif') and for any wrong inputs or miscellaneous cases we have else.

**TASK2**
Here, in **Assignment 2 TASK2**
The program starts with the 'sum50' variable that adds and stores all the values of different iterations of counter variable 'i' 
that is running a loop starting from 1 to 51(51 not included) using the code statement 'sum50=sum50+i' inside the loop. 
As mentioned before, all the numbers add up in the sum variable which after the loop ends is printed in the required format.
